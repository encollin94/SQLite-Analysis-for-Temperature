# SQLite-Analysis-for-Temperature
### **Purpose**
The purpose of this analysis was to gather temperature summary statistics for Oahu. The analysis was pulled from prior years data to help estimate the temperatures for vacationers this present year. Different tools used include VS Code, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Sqlalchemy.
### **Results**
Some results of this project include  
* The mean average temperature for Oahu is about 75 in June and 71 in December, suggesting that change in temperature over the six months is minimal.  
* The major difference in June and December is the minimum temperature. In June, the minimum temperature was 64 at a minimum while December has a minimum temperature was 56.

### **Summary**

Based on the temperature summaries, the temperature stays fairly consistent when looking at June and December. The standard deviation is fairly low for both months sitting at around 3 points, as well. When looking at vacationing, additional queries can be done to examine the climate when comparing the two months. One query that can be pulled should look at the precipitation in the last year for the two months. This will help vacationers know how to dress or if they will be able to participate in outdoor activities. Some more information that could be pulled from the climate as new data to observed could be factors such as UV intensity. UV intensity could be important as the tempertature is mostly sunny in this area. Knowing when to avoid being outside, due to UV damage could be important for the tourist safety.
